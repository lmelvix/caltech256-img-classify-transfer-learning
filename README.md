# CalTech256 Image Classification using Transfer Learning

In this project, we implemented a deep neural network for classifying CalTech256 image dataset using Keras. 
We used pre-trained VGG16 model as baseline and performed transfer learning on top of the model by training only the Soft-max layer. Using this tecnique, we achieved a classification accuracy of 66%
